# Introduction

**Nodens** is a simple framework for developing interactive applications on Windows. 

It combines third-party libraries with a core custom framework to provide:
 - user input processing and window management (from [GLFW](https://www.glfw.org/));
 - an immediate mode GUI (from [ImGui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui));
 - 2D/3D graph plotting (from [ImPlot](https://github.com/epezent/implot) and [ImPlot3D](https://github.com/brenocq/implot3d));
 - 3D rendering pipeline (with OpenGL backend using [glad](https://github.com/Dav1dde/glad));
 - frame profiling (from [Tracy](https://github.com/wolfpld/tracy) 0.11.1).
