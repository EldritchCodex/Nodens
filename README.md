# What is this

## Motivation
This is a study on the development of real-time rendering interactive applications (basically a game engine).

## Usage
The **Nodens Engine** is a framework for developing real-time interactive applications. It provides user input and window management (from GLFW), a costumizable GUI (from DearImGui), 2D/3D graph plotting (from ImPlot and ImPlot3D) and 3D rendering using OpenGL.
