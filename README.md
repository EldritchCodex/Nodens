# What is this

## Motivation
This is a study on the development of real-time rendering interactive applications (basically a game engine).

## Usage
The **Nodens Engine** is a framework for developing real-time interactive applications. It provides user input and window management (from [GLFW](https://www.glfw.org/)), a costumizable GUI (from [ImGui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui)), 2D/3D graph plotting (from [ImPlot](https://github.com/epezent/implot) and [ImPlot3D](https://github.com/brenocq/implot3d)), 3D rendering pipeline (OpenGL backend) and perfomance profiling (from [Tracy](https://github.com/wolfpld/tracy)).
